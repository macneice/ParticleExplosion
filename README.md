# ParticleExplosion
This repository shows an example of a particle explosion that uses a simple, and unoptimized box blur effect. <br />

Also, note that this program uses SDL 2, and has only been tested through visual studio; however, it should run on most Windows, Mac, and Linux machines once compiled.
